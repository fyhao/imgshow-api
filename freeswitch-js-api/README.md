==
Freeswitch is an open source SIP and IVR platform and you need to install on your server and enable JavaScript scripting in order to use Imgshow API.

To run this example:

If your Freeswitch installation is at /usr/local/freeswitch (linux platform),
then, put these two scripts (imgshow.js and example_ivr.js) into /usr/local/freeswitch/scripts

Configure your dialplan to use example_ivr.js. Check Freeswitch documentation on how to configure it.

Here you go.

You can reuse same Imgshow API code snippet like Node.JS version to perform your stuffs.
